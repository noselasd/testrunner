* Json output
* Clean up code
* Be able to run tests in parallell
* Optionally Specify text to compare against directly 
  in DefTest() instead of using .stdin/.stderr files 
* improve setup.py. use asciidoc/a2x to convert README
  to a manpage
* conform to an existing XML schema for testing frameworks 
  in the XML output

Non-todos:
* Replace code using cleaner but newer Python features.
  The testrunner needs to run on the default python package
  shipped with RHEL/CentOS 6 and up.
* Modularize the python code into several files/packages.
  Having the single testrunner.py makes it easier to integrate
  in existing build infrastructure.
